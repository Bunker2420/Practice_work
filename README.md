This folder contains the HTML practice files I created when I first began learning full-stack development. These basic exercises helped me build a strong foundation in web structure, semantics, and layout. Although simple, they represent the first steps in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer. I'm continually improving and building upon these fundamentals as I progress.
